## Summary

<image src="readme_files/screenshot.gif">

This project really pushed forward my understanding of working with the HTML canvas element. I also really expanded my understading of working with JavaScript arrays. I also graduated from window.onload and wrote my first IIFE function, so that was cool. Overall, a great project to complete.
